## Balanced Transport
**Balanced Minecraft** is a vanilla+ project which aims to make lesser used mechanics in survival more competitive with more popular progression paths. It should make the survival experience overall more novel and challenging, while making progression more satisfying.

**Balanced Transport** focuses on rebalancing transportation, mainly minecarts.
